## Overview

**Peri** (also pari, پری) are supernatural beings from Persian mythology, depicted as extremely beautiful, winged creatures. According to some traditions, peri descended from **fallen angels** who were denied paradise for some impurity or transgression, and now seek redemption through good deeds.

They are generally **benevolent spirits** who protect humans from evil forces, guide lost travelers, and oppose the malevolent **divs** (daevas) — the evil spirits of Persian mythology. Peri possess powers including flight, magic, beauty that captivates mortals, and shape-shifting.

Uniquely, peri are said to sustain themselves on **perfume and fragrance**, living on the scent of flowers and sweet aromas rather than physical food.

Originating from Persian/Zoroastrian traditions, peri were adapted into Islamic-era Persian literature and culture. They influenced Western concepts of fairies (the words are etymologically related) and appear prominently in Persian poetry, including Thomas Moore's famous "Lalla Rookh."

Peri represent themes of **redemption**, fallen grace, beauty, and guidance, embodying the eternal struggle between good and evil.

⚠️ **Cultural Sensitivity**: Peri are part of Persian/Zoroastrian cultural tradition and heritage.
