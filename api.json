      "full": "Peri (also pari) are supernatural beings from Persian mythology, depicted as extremely beautiful, winged creatures. According to some traditions, peri descended from fallen angels who were denied paradise for some impurity or transgression, and now seek redemption through good deeds. They are generally benevolent spirits who protect humans from evil forces, guide lost travelers, and oppose the malevolent divs (daevas). Peri possess powers including flight, magic, beauty that captivates mortals, and shape-shifting. They are said to sustain themselves on perfume and fragrance, living on the scent of flowers and sweet aromas. Originating from Persian/Zoroastrian traditions, peri were adapted into Islamic-era Persian literature and culture. They stand in opposition to divs/daevas, the evil spirits of Persian mythology. Peri influenced Western concepts of fairies and appear prominently in Persian poetry, particularly Thomas Moore's 'Lalla Rookh.' They represent themes of redemption, fallen grace, beauty, and the struggle between good and evil. Peri remain part of traditional Persian folklore and cultural heritage."
